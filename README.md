# Password_Generator

## Description

This password generator served as practicing Javascript. I was tasked with writing my own function that would display prompts with Window methods. As I worked, I became more familiar with scope and how it affects the accessibility of variables, if statements, and modifying arrays. This function was then used to edit the index.html to contain the generated password.
